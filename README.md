### Cesnored KO:
In order to display an understanding in the manipulatiion of preloaded images, this project was created. A preloaded jpg image of the knockout of Josue Vargas at the hands Jose Zepeda was inserted into the background. Superimposed over it was a screen grabbed png image of Gabriel Iglesias during a live comedy show shot many years ago. This image had it's width and length altered so that it would follow the exact location of the mouse cursor, but its code was edited so that it would always remain censoring the sight of the area of Zepeda's fist impact against Vargas' chin.

### TV Buttons:
This project was created attempting to implement simple user interactivity with programing. Taking the form of a computer moniter with buttons, the main function involved the pushing of buttons to get the _"screen"_ of the monitor to change colors. This could be accomplished either by pressing a specific **key** on the keyboard, or by clicking the mouse within one of the buttons. 

### AngryWADE:
An attempt to use the **ASCII**, which can be used to convert any and all images into walls of text, and/or even convert live video of repeating code into this as well. Each individual pixel of this image used is converted into text best suited to fill in its position on the canvas. These text points include numbers, letters, and even other special characters (or lack thereof). It's also possible to manipulate the colors to either make the text image fully colored or just black and white.
